16:27:30 <aindilis> can anyone recommend a graph/network toolkit for Java, I'm
      writing a task network browser editor for the POSI todo system
16:27:34 <aindilis> er, goal system
16:28:16 <flaushy> graph as graph theory?
16:28:20 <aindilis> yeah
16:28:32 <aindilis> http://frdcsa.org/~andrewdo/images/psex.jpg
16:29:25 <flaushy> to automaticly resolve dependecies?
16:29:38 <aindilis> um, what it is for is for editing the dependency graph
16:29:53 <aindilis> I have AI software that takes this, and other information
      such as timing and scheduling information, and plans everything out
16:30:09 <aindilis> what is needed is to craft/edit the available goals into a
      coherent and accurate system
16:30:17 <aindilis> it's more than just a dependency chart
16:30:48 <aindilis> http://frdcsa.org/~andrewdo/writings/semweb.pdf
16:30:56 <flaushy> okie, so more of a datastorage 
16:30:58 <aindilis> http://frdcsa.org/~andrewdo/writings/flourish-2009.odp
16:31:05 <aindilis> well I have the data storage written
16:31:18 <aindilis> It is essentially a predicate store
16:31:26 <aindilis> called freekbs
16:31:39 <aindilis> I have the ability to edit it tremendously with emacs
16:31:56 <aindilis> but that is slow for certain kinds of tasks, in
      particular, it is hard to visualize the overall graph layout
16:32:10 <aindilis> so I export using graphviz, but want the ability to edit
      the graph and to add new items
16:32:16 <flaushy> hmm okie
16:32:27 <flaushy> why not use latex for export?
16:32:36 <aindilis> I need dynamic graph visualization
16:32:40 <aindilis> it's a multiperson system
16:32:45 <flaushy> kk
16:32:49 <aindilis> web applets/stand alone
16:33:00 <aindilis> someone can add a dependecy and it updates on all clients
16:33:20 <aindilis> see, someone can enter a goal onto this very channel with
      the command "Goal: do this"
16:33:32 <aindilis> the bot asserts it into the knowledge base, and it updates
16:33:34 <flaushy> yeah kinda figure :)
16:33:47 <flaushy> distributed database with different views in a way :)
16:33:50 <aindilis> sure
16:34:00 <aindilis> :)
16:34:31 <aindilis> and then when a goal gets done, it get's grewed out, and
      eventually removed
16:34:37 <aindilis> my goal is to make it almost like a game
16:34:50 <flaushy> hmm why as a game?
16:35:02 <flaushy> to give back good feedback and target the player instinct?
16:35:09 <aindilis> well because it is designed to be real time
16:35:22 <aindilis> the system does automatic matching between goals as you
      assert new ones
16:35:29 <aindilis> using recognizing textual entailment
16:35:54 <aindilis> and of course users can declare two or more goals to be
      related in various ways, such as they are exactly the same, one entails
      the other, and so on
16:36:07 #posi> /names
16:36:07 *** Users on #posi: goibhniu posi-log-bot sYskk dfr|work flaushy
      en3r0 aindilis posingaspopular 
16:36:28 <flaushy> hmm okie
16:36:35 <flaushy> and all that needs to scale as well
16:36:48 <aindilis> well yeah, I'm not too concerned about scaling at first
16:37:10 <flaushy> yeah but that is where it makes sense, if others had the
      same goal, and you can extract that information
16:37:12 <aindilis> I imagine that among the early tasks will be researching
      and developing better backends/interfaces
16:37:55 <aindilis> do you understand about the way the system maps
      goals/interests/and abilities and uses that to plan for what the users
      can and possibly should do?
16:38:12 <flaushy> i read the slides some weeks ago i think
16:38:25 <aindilis> oh okay, well that was for the verber I'm guessing
16:38:29 <aindilis> POSI is a multiuser thing
16:38:42 <flaushy> but to be honest i am not too sure whether i understand
      correctly
16:38:45 <flaushy> okie
16:39:11 <flaushy> (corporate design makes the assumption too easy)
16:39:19 <aindilis> corporate design?
16:39:22 <flaushy> will read it completely then, but prolly tomorrow
16:39:32 <aindilis> oh thanks!
16:39:39 <flaushy> useing the same design over and over again, so it sticks :)
16:39:43 <aindilis> now that you have a decent picture of some of the
      requirements, do you know of any java graph editors?
16:39:45 <aindilis> ok
16:40:10 <flaushy> i know we have one, bbut it is to visualize algorithms
16:40:15 <aindilis> ah okay
16:40:19 <flaushy> it is very basic
16:40:26 <aindilis> yeah I would want the emacs of graph editors
16:40:27 <flaushy> and i fear it is homebrewn
16:40:28 <aindilis> lol
16:40:42 <flaushy> actually, i ll ask a prof
16:40:50 <aindilis> oh thanks!
16:40:56 <flaushy> we have a math prof, who is specialized in graph theory
16:41:07 <flaushy> formal concepts etc pp
16:41:34 <aindilis> well one of the POSI folks probably knows which software
      to use, but he was unavailable for a long time.  he just reappeared
      today, but has been catching up on some stuff and hasn't answered the
      question yet
16:41:55 <aindilis> and my 3 years of funding is up, I have to fend for myself
      with my own consultancy
16:42:03 <aindilis> so I am prioritizing the planning aspects of the POSI
      system
16:42:25 <flaushy> yeah
16:42:29 <aindilis> and hopefully it can help others, especially free software
      folks, into thriving during the recession and collaborating on free
      software
16:42:49 <flaushy> i would need such a tool, for organizing groups
16:42:55 <aindilis> how so?
16:43:10 <aindilis> what kind of groups?
16:43:16 <flaushy> i am in a couple of movements
16:43:16 <aindilis> (POSI is of course free software)
16:43:19 <aindilis> oh okay
16:43:27 <aindilis> flaushy: have you tried RT (request tracker)
16:43:31 <aindilis> that's pretty handy
16:43:34 <flaushy> students union i have been quite active
16:43:43 <flaushy> but the problem is time
16:43:45 <aindilis> I can give you an account on my instance and you can play
      around
16:43:54 <aindilis> well if you really need to, you can just use my server
16:43:58 <flaushy> not at the moment thanks :)
16:44:03 <aindilis> you can set up multiple queues
16:44:04 <aindilis> okay
16:44:15 <flaushy> thing is, we are lacking manpower
16:44:20 <aindilis> k
16:44:26 <flaushy> in all different things at university, you always meet the
      same guys
16:44:31 <aindilis> haha
16:44:34 <aindilis> sorry I KNOW
16:44:45 <flaushy> so finding "similiar goals" and helping is a huge aspect
16:44:52 <aindilis> that's why you really have to go online
16:44:57 <aindilis> and that's what POSI is designed for
16:45:05 <aindilis> but it's vaporware more or less at this point
16:45:05 <flaushy> yeah, that is what i had in mind
16:45:18 <aindilis> well I mean there is a lot of good stuff, but it's not up
      and running
16:45:23 <flaushy> more of the aspect of bringing the right ppl together
16:45:44 <aindilis> hrm, I should put you in touch with a hacker friend of
      mine, he's kinda scary but he was saying the same thing
16:45:44 <flaushy> and maybe being able to reuse the solution of a problem of
      somebody else
16:46:09 <aindilis> oh absolutely, whenever a task is complete, you log
      information as to where the solution is stored, what it is ,etc.
16:46:18 <flaushy> right
16:46:28 <flaushy> another aspect that comes in, is privacy concerns
16:46:33 <aindilis> definitely
16:46:44 <flaushy> because it works good, if it scales and has a certain size
16:46:57 <aindilis> yeah
16:47:03 <flaushy> so basicly you are doing yet another groupware, a kinda
      metagroupware tho
16:47:09 <aindilis> well, hrm
16:47:23 <flaushy> well not full groupware, just the task planning 
16:47:36 <aindilis> yes it is kind of groupware, but it uses AI that most
      groupware ignores
16:47:44 <flaushy> right
16:47:51 <aindilis> and it's based on the theory of software conglomeration,
      always building larger systems
16:48:09 <aindilis> but yeah, it's a form of groupware
16:48:15 <aindilis> with social network analysis
16:48:19 <flaushy> http://www.wv.inf.tu-dresden.de/ btw :)
16:48:45 <aindilis> yeah most groupware doesn't use those techniques.
      obviously more and more they will
16:48:55 <aindilis> is that your area?
16:49:07 <flaushy> nope
16:49:13 <flaushy> one chair
16:49:16 <flaushy> http://awv.inf.tu-dresden.de/Research/
16:49:20 <flaushy> that is another one
16:49:35 <flaushy> even tho, too applied for many in our field
16:50:12 <aindilis> oh
16:50:13 <flaushy> what i am thinking of is, who to contact for such things
16:50:31 <aindilis> please elaborate, what such things
16:51:05 <flaushy> well in which area your project falls, who might have the
      most information that could prove helpful
16:51:10 <aindilis> oh okay
16:51:24 <aindilis> thanks!
16:52:11 <flaushy> based on that i would ask students from the chairs
16:52:55 <flaushy> but i am thinking about it, whether it could be seen as a
      game and could be a problem being solved by the general game playing
      group
16:52:59 <aindilis> okay
16:53:07 <aindilis> well, I don't think so
16:53:21 <aindilis> because the world model is underspecified
16:53:30 <aindilis> but yeah, I guess it could be in many ways
16:53:59 <flaushy> http://www.fluxagent.org/ is the research project of
      another chair
16:54:43 <flaushy> well, what i am thinking of is that it would be cool, if
      you could simulate some stuff
16:54:59 <aindilis> oh okay
16:55:16 <flaushy> you know, you are a helper, and the question would be,
      where to help with minimal effort, to get maximum result
16:55:46 <aindilis> ah okay
17:01:53 <flaushy> btw, quick googling brings up JUNG and GEF (from tigris)
17:01:58 <aindilis> ah
17:02:02 <aindilis> hadn't seen GEF
17:02:32 <flaushy> http://gef.tigris.org/
17:07:30 <flaushy> night night
17:09:36 <aindilis> gnite!
