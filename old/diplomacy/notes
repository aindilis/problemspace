Some  skill is  required  in order  to  get people  to work  together,
especially when  the rewards are either distant,  esoteric etc..  This
problem has plagued us for a long time.

Recently, a solution came to mind.

This solution involves the following process.

The technique involves the following:

We can  use our goaling system  to represent, not only  our own goals,
but  those  goals that  other  tell  us about.   We  can  also use  an
intelligence  collection  procedure,  which  establishes  intelligence
about what  people are  doing, in order  to apply plan  recognition to
determine their objectives,  etc.  We can use automap  and these other
tools here to do this.

We  need to  set  up a  streaming  intelligence feed,  run it  through
automap - a  system for perception, and use this  as input to decision
makers  like Al.   We need  to get  Al  back in  the loop  as soon  as
possible.

Need to get voice over IP working.

This system is responsible for handling assets.  We identify what they
say  they want  to  do, through  our  goaling system,  and what  their
REASONS/motivations  are.   We  then  use  this to  determine  how  to
interact with them.

Operations  should  be  encrypte,  or   maybe  a  dual  set  of  books
maintained.
