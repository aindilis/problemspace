Use problemspace or some such thing to report


ProblemSpace is a system that provides some functionality that other
systems do provide.

Here are key features of battlespace.

Problemspace functions as a command post for the AI force.

AI force monitors goals and their dependencies.

It also  is responsible  for delegating authority  to others  based on
mixed  initiative.   It  uses  automated  techniques  to  monitor  the
progress of varoius people on various projects.

I  think I  will use  Java code  for this,  because it  is what  AI is
largely done in.

We can  use Java graph  layout algorithms.  Also,  there are a  lot of
Java programmers.

Colored icons are used to represent the resources of all commanders.

Mike has suggested that we have cool progress bars showing the work on
projects.  This would not be hard to achieve.  You could also use a
gantt chart.  You might have a sliding window that dynamically
displays both schedules in a gantt format, but also overlays plans and
estimated completion times, etc.
